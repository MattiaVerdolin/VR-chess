 * @brief Abstract base Camera class.
 *
 * The Camera class is an abstract base class for implementing different types of cameras in a 3D scene.
 * The camera defines the projection matrix and provides an interface for handling camera-specific rendering
 * and projection. It also handles window resizing to adjust the viewport and update the projection matrix.
