\doxylink{class_game_manager}{Game\+Manager} is responsible for managing the state and progression of the game, including handling user inputs, transitioning between game states, and controlling the camera, lights, pieces, and movements in the game world. It follows the Singleton design pattern to ensure that there is only one instance of \doxylink{class_game_manager}{Game\+Manager} during the game lifecycle.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\doxylink{class_game_manager}{Game\+Manager} is responsible for managing the state and progression of the game, including handling user inputs, transitioning between game states, and controlling the camera, lights, pieces, and movements in the game world. It follows the Singleton design pattern to ensure that there is only one instance of \doxylink{class_game_manager}{Game\+Manager} during the game lifecycle. 

This header defines the \doxylink{class_game_manager}{Game\+Manager} class and its methods for handling game initialization, game loop, and various callbacks for keyboard inputs during different game states (e.\+g., pre-\/game, choice, game, and end-\/game). It also manages the game state transitions and calls appropriate methods for handling game actions.
